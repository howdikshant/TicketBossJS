## 🧩 Problem Overview
Your city is hosting a **Node.js Tech Meet-up** with **500 total seats**.  
Partners (vendors, booking apps, or third-party APIs) can **reserve** or **cancel** seats simultaneously — without any risk of overselling.  

The challenge:  
> Handle **multiple concurrent requests** safely, **maintain data consistency**, and ensure **atomic seat updates** across transactions.

This system supports:
- 🔄 Real-time reservation and cancellation  
- 🔐 Concurrency-safe updates using versioning  
- 📊 Live event summary with auto-refresh  
- 🧮 Version increment on every data change

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/howdikshant/TicketBossJS.git
cd TicketBossJS
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running locally (default: `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`).

### Step 4: Run the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server will start at  
👉 **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**

### Step 5: Open Frontend
Open `public/index.html` in a browser or with VSCode’s Live Server.

<a id="concurrency--version-control"></a>
## ⚔️ Concurrency & Version Control
**Problem:**  
When multiple users try to reserve tickets simultaneously, the system must prevent race conditions and overbooking.  

**Solution:**  
This project uses **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**:
- Each `Event` document has a `version` field.
- On every update, Mongoose ensures the document’s version matches the stored version.
- If two updates happen at once, one succeeds, and the other throws a `Concurrency conflict` error.

### 🧪 Tested Using `test-concurrency.js`
```bash
node test-concurrency.js
```
The test simulates **10+ parallel booking requests**.  
Example output:
```
[1] ✅ Success: e3fbb7d4-04df-4e4f-b41b-f0c2f7c5c3b2
[2] ✅ Success: d81c3fae-25f1-48ef-83b8-6120c25a12d9
[3] ❌ Failed: Concurrency conflict – try again
...
Test completed.
```
✅ Successful bookings show reserved IDs  
❌ Failed ones show concurrency conflicts — proof of safe locking.

<a id="frontend-overview"></a>
## 🎨 Frontend Overview
- Simple, clean dashboard built using **HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS**.  
- Auto-updating **Event Summary** on page load.  
- Users can:
  - Reserve seats  
  - Cancel reservations  
  - View live seat availability and version number  

---

<a id="example-api-flow"></a>
## 🧠 Example API Flow
1. **POST** `/reservations/` → Partner A books 5 seats  
2. **POST** `/reservations/` → Partner B books 3 seats concurrently  
3. **DELETE** `/reservations/:id` → Partner A cancels  
4. **GET** `/reservations/` → Summary updates, version increments  

Every change increases the **version number** by `+1`.
