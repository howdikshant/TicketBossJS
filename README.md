# 🎟️ TicketBossJS — Real-Time Event Ticketing API (Node.js + Express)

> **TicketBossJS** is a backend application that implements a real-time event seat reservation system for a tech meet-up.  
> Built as part of the **Powerplay Backend Intern Challenge**, this project ensures **no overselling** of seats while allowing multiple partners to reserve and cancel tickets instantly.

## 🧩 Problem Overview

Your city is hosting a **Node.js Tech Meet-up** with **500 total seats**.  
Partners can use this API to **reserve** or **cancel** seats in real time.  
Overselling is **not allowed**, and each partner must get an **instant accept/deny response**.

The system supports:
- Real-time seat reservations  
- Reservation cancellation  
- Live event summary tracking  
- Version increment on every data update

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/howdikshant/TicketBossJS.git
cd TicketBossJS
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the Server
```
npm run dev
```

The API will start at  
👉 **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

### Step 4: Open the Frontend
Open `public/index.html` in your browser or use VSCode’s Live Server extension.  
The UI allows you to:
- Reserve seats  
- Cancel reservations  
- View live event summary

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### POST /reservations/ — Reserve Seats
#### Request Body
```
{
  "partnerId": "abc-corp",
  "seats": 3
}
```

#### ✅ 201 Created
```
{
  "reservationId": "f53a81e6-3d44-4f23-b2f1-3d79c2c347e1",
  "seats": 3,
  "status": "confirmed"
}
```

#### ⚠️ 400 Bad Request
```
{ "error": "Seats per request must be between 1 and 10" }
```

#### ❌ 409 Conflict
```
{ "error": "Not enough seats left" }
```

---

### DELETE /reservations/:reservationId — Cancel Reservation

#### ✅ 204 No Content
Seats are released back into the pool.

#### ❌ 404 Not Found
```
{ "error": "Reservation not found" }
```

---

### GET /reservations/ — Event Summary

#### ✅ 200 OK
```
{
  "eventId": "node-meetup-2025",
  "name": "Node.js Meet-up",
  "totalSeats": 500,
  "availableSeats": 476,
  "reservationCount": 8,
  "version": 5
}
```

---

## 🧠 Example API Flow

1. `POST /reservations/` → Partner A reserves 5 seats  
2. `POST /reservations/` → Partner B reserves 10 seats  
3. `DELETE /reservations/:id` → Partner A cancels  
4. `GET /reservations/` → Shows updated available seats and version increment

Every successful reservation or cancellation increments the **version** counter.

## 🧱 Technical Decisions

### Data Storage
- The event and reservation data are stored **in-memory and mirrored in JSON files** (`data.json`, `reservations.json`).
- In production, this would use **Redis** or **PostgreSQL** to handle concurrent access safely.

### Optimistic Concurrency Control
- A `version` key increments on every state change (reservation/cancellation).
- Ensures real-time consistency without overselling.

### Error Handling
- Proper validation for:
  - Invalid seat numbers (≤0 or >10)
  - Insufficient available seats
  - Missing or invalid reservation IDs

### Design Choices
- Endpoints kept **RESTful and minimal**
- Frontend built using **vanilla HTML/CSS/JS**
- No external frameworks — lightweight and dependency-minimal
